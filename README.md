Social-media data, specifically twitter data can be useful in helping to understand political trends and themes. 
This code scrapes data from twitter to understand:

1. Wich democrat candidates are trending more on twitter?
2. Where are they trending (geo-location and cities)?
3. What reasons are they trending for?
4. What are twitters users saying? And, where are they tweeting?

Network and Sentiment analysis allows us to dig deeper into these trends. For instance, what language is used to describe 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg?
