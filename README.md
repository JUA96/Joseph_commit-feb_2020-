# Sentiment Analysis using Tweet Data

Social-media data, specifically twitter data can be useful in helping to understand political trends and themes. 
This code uses to the R ``rtweet`` and ``search_tweets`` to scrape tweet data from twitter to understand:

**1. Wich democrat candidates are trending more on twitter?
2. Where are they trending (geo-location and cities)?
**3. What reasons are they trending for?
4. What are twitters users saying? And, where are they tweeting?

Using a collection of R's Network and Sentiment analysis libaries allows us to dig deeper into these trends. 

1. What language is used to describe the different candidates?
2. Does Sentiment towards political figures vary over time?
3. How much variation is there in attitudes towards Democratic figures by geo-location?

**N.B: This is a working project which will be updated regularly
