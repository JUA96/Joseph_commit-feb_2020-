# Sentiment Analysis using Tweet Data

Social-media data, specifically twitter data can be useful in helping to understand political trends and themes. 
This code uses to the R ``rtweet`` and ``search_tweets`` to scrape tweet data from twitter to understand:

1. Wich democrat candidates are trending more on twitter?
2. What language is used to describe the different candidates?
3. Where are candidates trending (geo-location and cities)?
4. What reasons are they trending for?
5. Does sentiment towards the candidates vary over time, if so how short a period?

Using a collection of R's Network and Sentiment analysis libaries allows us to dig deeper into these trends.
